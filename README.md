# React-Employee-Directory
Create a employee directory with React. Break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
<br><br><br>


User Story<br><hr>

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
<br><br><br>



Business Context<br><hr>

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
<br><br><br>


Acceptance Criteria<br><hr>

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.<br>

The user should be able to:<br>

Sort the whole table by at least one category<br>

Filter individual users by at least one property.<br>

<!-- 
I think I'll have one SearchForm. Maybe have one feature be a switch or option bubbles to SORT by category and an input text box to FILTER by property. That will search through the JSON file with all the user names. 

Going to use: 
- Act 16 Friends List (appending to page)
- Act 18 Forms (maybe)
- Act 20 Movie Search (appending to page)
- Act 23 Pupster (filtering by one property - name)


Start with the Search page layout from Act 23
and go from there.
